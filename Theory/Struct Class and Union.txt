Struct vs Class
--------------------------------

- All variables and functions in classes is private by default.
- All variables and functions in structs is public by default.

- Classes are inherited in private by default. 
- Structs are inherited in public by default 

Stucture Alignment rules:
-----------------------------

All variables are padded according to size of largest variable
eg. char c1, double d, char c2 is of size (1+7)+8+(1+7) = 24. A padding of 7 bytes is given to each char
eg. char c1, char c2, double d is of size (2+6)+8 = 16. A padding of 6 bytes is given after both chars

- Usually double is stored at an address starting at a multiple of 8, int at address starting at a multple of 4, etc.

- For conserving space, declare variable in struct/class in either increasing or decreasing order of sizes.

Unions
------------------------------

Very crazy things
size of a union is equal to the size of its largest variable.
 
- Applications include "Type punning"
